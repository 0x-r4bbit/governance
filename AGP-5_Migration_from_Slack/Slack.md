# [Slack](https://slack.com/)

### Projects currently using this platform

- [Numerai](https://numer.ai/)

### Pros
- Allows 3rd party integrations/extensions
- Group mentions (@channel @everyone) with limit for admins
- Custom emojis, reactions, message pinning and starring
- Custom theming
- Well working web, desktop and mobile clients

### Cons
- No intent to ever support public facing communities; Slack is meant for internal use of teams with only trusted members in the community
- No built in moderation tools (requires 3rd party integrations)
- 10k message limit unless paid
- Easy to abuse bots (`/remind @user MyEtherWallet has been hacked. Please visit scamlink.com to resolve in 1 minute`)
- Easy to create official sounding usernames (@MyEtherWalletBot)
- Proprietary software, no way to extend or maintain it ourselves
- Limited to one channel that can be Read Only so that only Admins can post
- Only two/three types of Roles: Admins and Users (Guests are available but rarely used)
- Centralized platform, single-point of failure, if Slack has issues with servers or connectivity, everything goes offline
- No possible way to create a wider umbrella community, ie. Ethereum Community under which Projects can live
- Horrible Admin tools that require usage of web version
