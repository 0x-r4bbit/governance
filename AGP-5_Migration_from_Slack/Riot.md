### Projects currently using this platform

- [Parity](https://parity.io)
- [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network)

### Pros
- Federated architecture: Any user in any community could talk to another one in another different community, seamlessly
- Decentralized infrastructure; has central service at matrix.org but self-deployed instances are supported
- End-to-end encryption for private messages and public as well as closed group chats: Useful for internal communications, for example
- Built using React, easy to maintain and work on
- Numeral user-levels, easy to set different levels for usergroups, ie. 50 for Moderator, 100 for Admin
- Communities: Ability to create Communities provides the project ability to create multiple channels within their Community and visible to users within the Community, removes bloating from the interface
- Communities will provide ability to do Community wide bans (Unsure if a community can join a community to create an umbrella community for ie. Ethereum Community wide bans)
- They have message pinning and message editing
- Reactions coming by the end of 2017
- Basic moderation and rich moderation API
- Roadmap for upvotes/downvotes on messages and per-member reputation
- Usernames can contain flags, similar to Reddit, to signal status in the community
- Notifications: Work on web, desktop and mobile, includes notifications inbox
- Native mobile clients for Android and iOS, and [desktop too](https://github.com/mujx/nheko)
- Mobile clients are superior to Rocket.Chat's, work well

### Cons

- UX is bad, specially for newcomers
- Encryption / key exchange is buggy and keeps causing issues in encrypted channels, unfortunately
- Lack of message reactions, but as seen above, they're coming by the end of 2017
- They are having [funding](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2977) [issues](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix/) and require a very significant amount of capital to continue with the project for the next 18 months, at least
- No customization options in the client for Projects
