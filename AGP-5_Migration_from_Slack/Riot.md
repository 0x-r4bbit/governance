### Projects currently using this platform

- [Parity](https://parity.io)
- [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network)

### Pros
- Federated architecture: Any user in any community could talk to another one in another different community, seamlessly
- End-to-end encryption for private messages and closed group chats: Useful for internal communications, for example
- Built using React, easy to maintain and work on
- Numeral user-levels, easy to set different levels for usergroups, ie. 50 for Moderator, 100 for Admin
- They have features for communities coming by the end of Sep: This will implement a per-community view, instead of having all different channels from all different communities bloating the interface
- They have message pinning, message editing and reactions coming by the end of 2017
- Basic moderation and rich moderation API
- Roadmap for upvotes/downvotes on messages and per-member reputation
- Usernames can contain flags, similar to Reddit, to signal status in the community

### Cons

- UX is bad, specially for newcomers
- Encryption / key exchange is buggy and keeps causing issues in encrypted channels, unfortunately
- Lack of message pinning, editing and reactions, but as seen above, they're coming by the end of 2017
- They are having [funding](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2977) [issues](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix/) and require a very significant amount of capital to continue with the project for the next 18 months, at least
